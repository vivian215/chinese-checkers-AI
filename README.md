7. Unzip the file and find the "Images" folder
8. Drag and drop the Images folder into the "Bin" folder, which is located inside the folder of the java project that YOU have created for this game
9. And you're done!! Run the code that you have copy pasted into the code editor that you have been using, and enjoy :)
